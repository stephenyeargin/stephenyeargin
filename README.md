I'm a software engineer working for the [Vanderbilt Institute of Clinical and Translational Research (VICTR)](https://victr.vumc.org) in Nashville, Tennessee. My primary assignment these days is for the [_All of Us_ Research Program Data and Research Center](https://allofus.nih.gov/funding-and-program-partners/data-and-research-center). We're working to build one of the most diverse health databases in history with the aim of [helping researchers](https://www.researchallofus.org/) develop better treatments and prevent diseases.
